# knapsack_problem
A more advanced knapsack problem which considers not only weight and value, but also strength of the item (Items chance to break) and the ease of sale (How difficult an item is to sell) of the item

# Structure of key things
## Member of the population
An individual member consists of a dictionay of two items, "values" and "fitness", e.g {"values": [0,0,0...0], "fitness": 0}, critically the "values" is a list of 1's and 0's which represent the members selection of items avaliable, this list is known as the genome of the member. The fitness of the member is a measure to chose which members will become a part of the parent population, the higher the fitness value the more likely they will be selected into the parent population and reproduce for future genertaions.

## Knapsack Structure
The knapsack can simply be imagined as a bag which has a maximum carrying capacity, the generate_knapsack.py file generates this bag along with *n* number of items as specified by the user when running the body_code.py file, the number of items generated is a random number within a range unless both the lower bound and upper bound are the same.

# Description of each file
body_code.py: is the main body of code, it calls all other files (Except the csv file which has yet to have its functionality added). If you want to run this code just run the code in this file after getting the code

crossover_mutation.py: is the code that defines the crossover_mutation function, which takes the parent population, and randomly takes members inorder to splice their genome. At which point each value within evey members genome will have a 5% chance to be selected to flip bits, from a 0 to a 1 or visea versa.

generate_fitness.py: the code in this file generates the fitness for any given member of the population

generate_ipop.py: this code generates the inital population, by generating random members which consist of a single genome.

generate_knapsack.py: the code in this file generates the inital knapsack as per the above documentation (Knapsack Structure)

select_pop.py: the code in this file uses the fitness values generated by "generate_fitness.py" to perform firstly a superiority selection and then a tournament selection to generate a popultion half the size of the inital population which is known as the parent population.

Both Authors (z5358691 and William-Papantoniou) are the same person me :) William Papantoniou, z5358691 is my UNSW Student ID which is why both authors exist (Yes I didnt know how to set my name till I started to use the new Author lol)
